Hi—thanks for stopping by. I study how to make decisions that hold up when data or environments shift. My work focuses on uncertainty quantification and decision-making under uncertainty, aiming for methods that are principled yet practical.
Ongoing work
Nonparametric confidence intervals via the Cheap Bootstrap (with Prof. Henry Lam): Asymptotically exact CIs for bagged predictors using a small, fixed number of resamples with growing bag size; applicable to Random Forests and bagged SAA in stochastic optimization.
 Arindam_CV


Superiority of naïve optimization via stochastic dominance (with Prof. Henry Lam): When ERM can outperform DRO/regularization in worst-case regret under joint data and distributional uncertainty.
 Arindam_CV


Rare-event probabilities using Extreme Value Theory (with Prof. Henry Lam): Estimating tail probabilities using GPD as a model-agnostic alternative to importance sampling.
 Arindam_CV


Fantasy-sports user behavior (with Dream Sports): Causal impact of platform actions (promotions/incentives) on engagement at production scale.
 Arindam_CV


Multivariate flight-data modeling (NASA Langley): Tractable optimization with polynomial features; internal Python package and MATLAB implementation; estimation with non-normalized statistical models.
